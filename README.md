To get the best out of CodeXR, you should:
* Split large functions into many, smaller functions.
* Use prompts that are self explanatory.
* Use comments to explain your code.

## Terms of Use
CodeXR uses OpenAIs Codex AI model. This means the following terms must be followed AT ALL TIMES.
* CodeXR MUST NOT be used for reasons other than code completion. This means conversing with the AI and manipulating the AI are prohibited.
* CodeXR MUST NOT be used to generate code that may be offensive to anyone.
* Code generated by CodeXR MUST NOT be automatically executed on completion. This means all code generated should be reviewed before building, distributing, or publishing.
