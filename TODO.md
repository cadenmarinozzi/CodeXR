# Todo
* Allow CodeXR to be used inside code
ex: function discreteFourierTransform(|cursor_here|) => function discreteFourierTransform(signal, data)
* Code rework
* Realtime (Inline or another method)
* Tests (UGHHHHHH)
# Completed
* Add support for python comments
* Have the deployer scan each directory in the codebase for a "deploy-config.json" file that contains the script and envirpment variables to deploy withs
* Give context from after the current line of code
* Completion cache
